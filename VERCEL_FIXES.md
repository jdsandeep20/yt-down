# ðŸ”§ Vercel Deployment Fixes Applied

## ðŸš¨ Issue: "Failed to fetch video information" error on deployed site

The YouTube downloader was failing on Vercel due to serverless environment incompatibilities with the YouTube extraction libraries.

## âœ… Fixes Applied:

### 1. **Dynamic Imports for Serverless Compatibility**
- Changed static imports to dynamic imports for `@distube/ytdl-core`
- Added proper error handling when imports fail
- Better memory management for serverless functions

### 2. **Fallback Method with YouTube oEmbed API**
- Added a fallback method using YouTube's official oEmbed API
- Provides basic video information when ytdl-core fails
- Returns standardized format information for downloads

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added comprehensive error catching and logging
- Graceful fallback between different extraction methods
- User-friendly error messages for different failure scenarios

### 4. **Optimized Timeouts**
- Reduced timeout from 15s to 10s for faster failures
- Updated Vercel function timeouts (15s for video-info, 60s for download)
- Better resource management for serverless environment

### 5. **TypeScript Fixes**
- Fixed all type errors for production builds
- Proper typing for API responses and video formats
- Safe type assertions for external library responses

## ðŸ”„ Updated Files:

### API Routes:
- **`src/app/api/video-info/route.ts`**: Complete rewrite with fallback system
- **`src/app/api/download/route.ts`**: Dynamic imports and better error handling

### Configuration:
- **`vercel.json`**: Updated function timeouts and build settings
- **`next.config.ts`**: Added serverless optimization

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results After Redeployment:

1. **Video Info Fetching**: Will work using either ytdl-core or fallback oEmbed API
2. **Download Functionality**: Enhanced with better error handling
3. **User Experience**: Clear error messages for unavailable videos
4. **Performance**: Faster timeouts and better resource usage
