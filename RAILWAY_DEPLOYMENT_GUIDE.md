## 📊 **Monitoring & Logs:**

### **Railway Dashboard Features:**
- ✅ **Real-time logs** - See all download attempts
- ✅ **Resource usage** - Monitor CPU and memory
- ✅ **Deployment history** - Roll back if needed
- ✅ **Environment variables** - Easy configuration
- ✅ **Custom domains** - Use your own domain

### **Useful Commands:**
```bash
# Install Railway CLI (optional)
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy from terminal
railway login
railway link
railway up
```

---

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting:**

### **If Build Fails:**
```bash
# Check these in your package.json:
{
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18.0.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  }
}
```

### **If App Won't Start:**
```bash
# Railway needs PORT environment variable
# Add to your next.config.ts:
const nextConfig = {
  // ... your existing config
  env: {
    PORT: process.env.PORT || 3000
  }
}
```

### **If Downloads Still Fail:**
This shouldn't happen on Railway, but if it does:
```bash
# Check Railway logs for specific errors
# Most likely YouTube API changes, not Railway issues
```
